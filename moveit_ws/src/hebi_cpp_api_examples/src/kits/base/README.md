# Overview

These examples demonstrate use of the C++ API directly from ROS nodes. These wrap up this functionality and low-level module communication, and expose a higher-level "system" interface on ROS topics, actions, and services.

**Important: to run any of these commands, you will need to run `source devel/setup.sh` from your catkin workspace first**

# Base nodes (`omni_base_node`, `diff_drive_node`)
